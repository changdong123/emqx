## Bug Fixes

- Fixed load bootstrap file when no bootstrap user in `mqtt_app` [#9474](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9474).

- Trigger `message.dropped` hook when QoS2 message is resend by client with a same packet id, or 'awaiting_rel' queue is full [#9486](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9486).

- When dashboard creates a new user, the password length must match 3-32 and the format is `^[A-Za-z0-9]+[A-Za-z0-9-_]*$` [#9475](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/9475).

- Fixed EMQX Helm Chart using incorrect secret values when custom credentials are provided [#9508](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9508).

- Fixed EMQX Helm Chart can not set JSON type value for EMQX Broker configuration items [#9504](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9504).

- When resource creation is too slow, there may be some temporary probing connections left [#9539](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9539).

- After a reconnect, the unacknowledged QoS1/QoS2 messages in non-clean session were not retransmitted periodically as before the reconnect [#9627](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9627).
  The configuration `zone.<zone-name>.retry_interval` specifies the retransmission interval of
  unacknowledged QoS1/QoS2 messages (defaults to 30s).
  Prior to this fix, unacknowledged messages buffered in the session are re-sent only once after session take-over, but not retried at configured interval.

- The expired 'awaiting_rel' queue is not cleared after persistent session MQTT client disconnected [#9627](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9627).
  Before this change, if the 'awaiting_rel' queue is full when the MQTT client reconnect
  to the broker and publish a QoS2 message, the client will get disconnected by the broker
  with reason code RC_RECEIVE_MAXIMUM_EXCEEDED(0x93), even if the packet IDs in the 'awaiting_rel'
  queue have already expired.
